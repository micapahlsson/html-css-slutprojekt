          Tina Jones founded Triply in 2017 after visiting Sweden and <br/>
          not finding enough trip advisors to help her fulfill her desire. <br />
          She wanted to explore Sweden in the way she knew she could. This <br/>
          inspired her to come together with her 5 employees, and <br/>
          now dear friends, to create a space where travelers, as well as <br/>
          locals, could find fun ideas and pre planned out trips to <br/>
          make the most of their time in Sweden!<br/>

          Tina Jones - <br/>
          "Sweden might be a small country, but it's filled with <br/>
          beauty and so much to offer. I want tourists, and even locals, <br/>
          to see more of what the country has to offer. This is why I <br/>
          started Triply Sweden!"
