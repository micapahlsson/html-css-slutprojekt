        Tina Jones founded Triply in 2017 after visiting Sweden and <br />
        not finding enough trip advisors to help her fulfill her desire <br />
        to explore Sweden in the way she knew she could. That <br />
        inspired her to come together with her now 5 employees and <br />
        dear friends to create a space where travelers, as well as <br />
        locals, could find fun ideas and pre planned out trips to <br />
        make the most of their time in Sweden!<br />

        Tina Jones - <br />
        "Sweden might be a small country, but it's filled with <br />
        beauty and so much to offer. I want tourists, and even locals, <br />
        to see more of what the country has to offer. This is why I <br />
        started Triply Sweden!"
